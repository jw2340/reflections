When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate with other people. When you want to make your work available to the public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Some changes might be made by another person. Those changes might not be needed yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used in github. Clones are used to download repositories from github to local. Branches can be used in a repository - both local and github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can see what you pushed/pulled most recently. You can also find what others have added
to the remote easily.
